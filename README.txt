Full Window Interactive Slider let's you use full window sliders with images and add interctive and customizable pins with info, links or shortcodes. 

== Description ==

With Full Window Interactive Slider you'll be able to add interactive pins to your slides.

Those interactive pins may contain title and subtitle, links, shorcodes or any other content.

As well, you can personalize those pins with custom images.

It works with the WP image media library, so all your files will be stored in the uploads folder as any other media.

The slider will take in account the device screen size as well as redimensioning actions to relocate the pins so it's fully responsible.

It is intended to be used as a showcase or product catalog, so you can use an image and expand the information with text.

For example, if you have a Woocommerce, you might use some products in one advertisment.
With Full Image Interactive Slider, you can use that image and link each product to it's product page.

See the examples/screenshots to find out more.

Note: All images in the same slider MUST HAVE THE SAME SIZE or proportions to work correctly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Image sizes are weird or incorrect =

You should waste a couple of minutes on planning your slider.
All the images in the slide have the same size, so you don't see weird effects.
As well take in account windows sizes and pin only inside a safe area, so pins will be visible in all devices.

= Why I can't see some pins? =

The slide image resizes to fit the screen. That's 100% width OR 100% height, not both. Some parts of your image may be outside that area, so the pins are not visible.

= Can I change the pin image? =

Yes you can. You only need to click 'change pin' on the box editing form and select whatever you want. Just a couple of things. 
The plugin will relocate the pin so it appears top and centered from the position you clicked.
Therefore, best practise is to make 50px by 50px pins, with the point in the bottom center position.
We'll be imporving this in the future.

= Can I change the info box style? =

Yes you may. To do so you should be overriding the styles in the CSS file of your theme. 
We don't use important! tag, so if there's something hard to override, just add the 'body' tag before the class selector.

= Why does the slider only work 'vertically'? =

Due to some JS effects we've only managed it to work this way. We'll work it out in the future if we get enought downloads.

= Why can't I customize more options? =

Full Window Interactive Slider it's been just released. More features are incoming.
Stay up to date and get a license to benefit from future developments.
